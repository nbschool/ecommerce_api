# ecommerce_api
## Getting Started

This document explains our an e-commerce API. The API structure:
* **/views** directory contains the three main elements(item, order and user)
* **/tests** directory contains the test of the main elements
* **models.py** contains the database models for the application
* **app.py** opens and closes the database and carry out the post and put methods of the three elements which can be seen on the server by adding /items/,/orders/ or /users/.
* **schemas.py** checks if the user input data is valid
* **.env** it contains all the environment variables that we use, the content of which is a list of variables = value

## Installing
 
What you need to install (can be found in the file **requirements.txt**)
 
## Running the server

To start the server in normal mode:
```
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```

To start the server in debug mode:
```
FLASK_DEBUG=1  FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```

### Heroku
All the env variables should be put in the ```.env``` file, in the root folder. The syntax is, for example:
```
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

To start the server locally on Heroku:
```
heroku local
```

To use the development Procfile (without gunicorn) use the -f flag:
```
heroku local -f Procfile.dev
```

## Create a TestModel

To create a class that tests some model use:

```
TestCase
```
TestCase is a class that imports all the models and then defines ```setup_class``` and ```setup_method```.
Import your models in **test_case.py**:
```
from models import Item, Order, OrderItem, User
```
add it in ```TABLES``` array:
```
TABLES = [Order, Item, OrderItem, User]
```


Import it in your **test_model.py**:
```
from tests.test_case import TestCase
```
Inherit it in your model:
```
class TestModel(TestCase):
```
Define some function that must starts with ```test```:
```
def test_my_function(self):
    assert True
```

## Running the tests

To perform the test of the project:

```
pytest
```
