Utility scripts
===============

This section explains what the ``scripts`` folder content does and how to use it.


.. contents:: :local:


.. TODO:: Write documentation for the scripts

    Each script should have its own ``rst`` file explaining it. The content can be either
    wrote directly in the rst file or autogenerated from the source code (that should be linked
    anyway)

    * [ ] DB init
