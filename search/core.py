    Calculate the match for the given `query` and `string`.

    The match is calculated using the `jaro winkler` for each set of the matrix

    Main function of the package, allows to do a fuzzy full-text search on the
    rows of the given `table` model, looking up the value
    on the given `attributes` list against the passed `query` string.

    Extra arguments allows some customization on the search results (see below)

    Arguments:
        query (str): String to search for
        attributes (list): The names of thetable columns to search into.
        dataset (iterable): iterable of `objects` to lookup. All the objects
            in the dataset **must** have the specified attribute(s)
        limit (int): max number of results to return. if ``-1`` will return
            everything.
        threshold (float): value under which results are considered not valid.
        weights (list): matching `attributes` argument, describes the
            attributes weights. if not provided **or** if different length
            the weight will generated automatically, considering
            the index of the attribute name, reversed (first -> more weight).

    Returns:
        list: A list containing ``[0:limit]`` resources from the given table,
        sorted by relevance.

    Raises:
        AttributeError: if one of the object does not have one of the given
            attribute(s).

    Example:
        Assuming a random number of items in the Item table, that defines
        `name`, `category`, `description`, `availability`, one can do:

        >>> from models import Item
        >>> from search import search
        >>> results = search('awesome', ['name', 'category'], Item.select())
        [<Item name: 'awesome item' cat: 'generic'>]

        >>> from search import search
